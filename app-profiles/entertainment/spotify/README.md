Spotify is a music streaming service

https://open.spotify.com/

[Spotify Profile](spotify.yaml)

Spotify uses a browser of your choice for the login, that´s why you need to allow your own IP in the Browsers Outgoing and in Spotifys Incoming Rules. 

Error Example:

This site can’t be reached
127.0.0.1 took too long to respond.
Try:
•	Checking the connection
•	Checking the proxy and the firewall
•	Running Windows Network Diagnostics
ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT

127.0.01 is your IP, if you see this Error open Portmaster and look at the Rules from the Browser you are using under "Settings" and "Rules" now allow your IP in the Outgoing Rules.
The same goes for Spotify but you now need to allow your IP in the incoming Rules.
