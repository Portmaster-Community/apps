Instagram is a web app, that means that all connections run over a specific browser
wich is usually your standard browser. If you donÂ´t know wich browser the Applikation
uses you can either look into the portmaster network monitor and look for the connections
of the app. Or you can block all the connections of your browser and try to open the app
again, now you will see an error and the icon of the browser the app is using.
