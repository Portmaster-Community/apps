[Excel Profile](excel.yaml)

if you want to save documents via One drive you need to press "allow" in portmaster when excel shows blocked activity with onedrive.
Error example for Onedrive:

https:/example_name-my.sharepoint.com/personal/example@email.com/documents
Path does not exist
Check the path and try again

In Portmaster you will now see the https://shairpoint... domain wich you now need to allow and than retry saving the document in onedrive
