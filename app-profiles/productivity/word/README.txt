[Word Profile](word.yaml)

if you want to save documents via One drive you need to press "allow" in portmaster when word shows blocked activity with onedrive.
Error example for Onedrive:

https:/example_name-my.sharepoint.com/personal/example@email.com/documents
Path does not exist
Check the path and try again

In Portmaster you will now see the https://shairpoint... domain wich you now need to allow and than retry saving the document in onedrive 

Same goes for downloading images from online providers, here you can either allow all activity while downloading the image or search for the provider and allow the domain in portmaster
after downloading the image go to "settings" "rules" and delete the "allow" rule for the image provider
