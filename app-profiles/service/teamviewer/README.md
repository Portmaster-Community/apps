TeamViewer lets you establish a connection to any PC or server within
just a few seconds.

[TeamViewer Profile](teamviewer.yaml)

Teamviewer uses multiple Routers. The Domains for these connections are:
router00.teamviewer.com 
You donÂ´t need to allow all 16 connections because Teamviewer tries all of them when
started, but Teamviewer will get slower the less Routers you allow in the Rules Section.
