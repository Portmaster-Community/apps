# Thunderbird
Thunderbird is an e-mail client

[Thunderbird Profile](thunderbird.yaml)

Thunderbird needs connection to your e-mail provider to get access to your account, if your e-mail doesnt work you need to press "allow"
in portmaster when Thunderbird shows activity with your e-mail provider. when you finished creating your account you 
can go to "settings" and "rules" to delet connections you donÂ´t need. 

Luckily Thunderbird shows the domains you need. Error example:

Sending of the message failed.
The message could not be sent because the connection to Outgoing server (SMTP) smtp.office365.com timed out. Try again.

This means you need to allow the domain smtp.office365.com in portmaster. This also goes for all other errors that are specific to your e-mail
provider
